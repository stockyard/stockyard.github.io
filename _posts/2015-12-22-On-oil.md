title: On oil
---

Today, as oil falls to record lows, many of us may wonder, what will happen to the price next, especially since Iran is soon to return to the market. Now, let's have a look at the oil production and consumption (data provided by the [U.S. Energy Information Administration](https://www.eia.gov/)):

Note the intersection and the switch of leads that occured back in 2014, it's main responsible factor for the future decline in prices. Now, let's calculate the delta between these two:

First, it's easy to note how huge it was in the late 2014 and during the whole 2015. And next -- that it's going to shrink down in 2016. Why so? As EIA states, that's because of the decline in the production by non-OPEC states<sup>1</sup>:

Which exactly? Russia, on the contrary, only [increases](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-20/siberian-surprise-russian-oil-patch-just-keeps-pumping) its [production](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-20/siberian-surprise-the-numbers-behind-russia-s-oil-resilience), Brazil's Petrobras [while](http://en.mercopress.com/2015/09/17/petrobras-oil-gas-production-in-august-sets-new-records-subsalt-output-up-61-in-twelve-months) not with [particular good results](http://petroglobalnews.com/2015/12/strike-puts-small-dent-in-petrobras-november-production/) after the strike, is back in action, Norway's production is [still](http://www.hellenicshippingnews.com/start-of-oil-production-at-the-edvard-grieg-field-in-the-norwegian-north-sea/) [expanding](http://www.offshore-technology.com/news/newslundin-discovers-oil-in-rolvsnes-prospect-offshore-norway-4760583) and is higher than expected (November's numbers are 1'598'000 barrels of oil, which is about 3% above the oil production back in November, 2014), and Canada is rather [steady](http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Energy-Industry/2015/12/17/Canadian-oil-sector-resilient-sort-of/6001450350312/), too.

Apparently, it the United States itself, who are to blame:

> Non-OPEC production growth in 2015 is largely attributable to investments committed to projects before the oil price decline that began in mid-2014. The declines in 2016 are mostly because of declines in U.S. onshore and North Sea production.

Then, how will it affect the price? My guess is not much: the spread between the consumption and the production is still pretty solid, and that reality is to be here for some time. On the other hand, having in mind the lifting of the export ban and the return of the Iran, decline in some -- unprofitable -- projects will only support and bolster others, which are steadier for now.
