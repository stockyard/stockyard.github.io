title: On contango

[Contango](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contango), as we are taught, is the situation where the futures price of a commodity is higher than the expected spot price. Or, as one may notice, exactly the today's situation with oil futures.

Thus, it can be avoided by switching to oil proxies -- such as oil producers’ currencies. Let's have a look how does these currencies may not only help investors to escape the contango situation, but also to guard their investments in a case of price drop. First, let's examine the two year period, since the beginning of 2014 until today:

Sure, Russia and Brazil doesn't look that well. But as of Canadian dollar or Mexican peso, the situation looks much more stable: the economies of these states, due to a certain diversification, act as a hedge themselves, smoothing both losses and possible wins. Which is exactly why one shouldn't be betting on that proxy in the long run -- but as of a critical moment with a huge price drop it still may save some cents:

However, investors must also keep in mind two other aspects. First, the national banks of commodity producing states in times of price drops may be tempted to depreciate states' currencies (in order to avoid a budget deficit, for instance), which may hit hard on such holdings. Another nuance that is now more actual than before -- is the rising U.S. dollar, which again may act as an additional hit.

Having said that, it's completely understood then to turn either to dollar-denominated oil-producing companies' bonds, or to their stocks -- this is how some selected stocks looked during the two-year period alongside with oil:

…and also during the most recent events:

But then again, there's a catch, obviously. First, one must try to avoid energy-services companies (such as Halliburton or Schlumberger), these are the most open towards price drops and may react awfully. Second, same goes for battered exploration and production enterprises, too (like Noble Energy, Goodrich Petroleum, etc). The safest bet would be integrated energy companies, which -- again, due to some diversification within a company itself -- would act as an airbag against a possible choppiness.
