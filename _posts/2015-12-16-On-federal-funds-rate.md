title: On federal funds rate
---

Today, as everybody's eyes are on the Federal Reserve and its expected decision to hike the federal funds rate (probably by 0.25%), it may be interesting to take a look at the Treasury yield curve rates -- how do they react before the possible rise, or, in other words, how does the market feels about possible perspectives?

And also on the U.S. dollar rates towards another currencies:

However, the outlook does look rather strange, doesn't it? Why indeed a higher Fed-funds rate does not increase the return on dollar-denominated deposits? And why the dollar itself doesn't start to look attractive?

The truth, however, is that financial markets have already priced in the initial hike after repeated signals from the interest-rate setting committee. As “ Doug Borthwick, the head of currency trading at Chapdelaine & Co, has put it: 

> Given the Fed’s reluctance to raise rates over the past 12 months, it’s much more likely that after raising rates, they’ll adopt a significantly dovish tone and stress that they have no intention of raising rates at any particular [rapid] pace going forward.

Or, to put it simply, the enthusiasm was here but now seems to be way more cautious than initially.
