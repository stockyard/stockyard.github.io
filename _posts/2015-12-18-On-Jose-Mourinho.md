title: On Jose Mourinho
---

Now, some sport news: the football club from London, named Chelsea, for a second time [fired](https://t.co/WUNSyOco5g) the same manager, named [Jose Mourinho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Mourinho).

During his brilliant career (and I put no sarcasm here), Mourinho was fired three times in total: apart from the above mentioned being the most recent one, it was, obviously, again by Chelsea FC back in 2007, and also by Real Madrid CF in 2013. On the other side, these three are the only clubs where he spent more than 2 seasons in a row.

Then, what exactly happened during these tenures? Let's have a look at his clubs' performance in the national championships: let's add one point for a win, deduce one point for a defeat, and give nothing for a draw:

Spot a pattern? The third year seems like a bit sloppy, one may say. Now, let's combine these three in one graph for a clearer picture:

Whatever happens to Jose during his stay at a club, the third year definitely doesn't look like the reason to continue working there. Does he lose his appetite? The passion or even the interest for the game? Or, may be problems with his players and the stuff arise? Nobody can answer that. But if he would be an enterprise, I'd be shorting his stocks every third year, that's for sure.
