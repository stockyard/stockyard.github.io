Can economists predict wars? Can they explain those even post-factum? Were they able to see the Great War coming back in 1914, for instance? No, markets were stable and rising back then. However, having said that, let's have a look at two Russian stock market indices, [RTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTS_Index) and [MICEX](http://www.micex.com/marketdata/indices/shares/composite#&index=MICEXINDEXCF). The first one is a free-float capitalization-weighted index of 50 Russian stocks traded on the Moscow Exchange and calculated in the US dollars. The second one is the same but calculated in Russian Rubles.

Now, let's compare those with the Russian Ruble for the time period since the beginning of 2013 and till the April, 2014:

As long as the Ruble's [exchange rate](http://i.imgur.com/6nUvLRB.png) seemed stable, RTS, the US dollar denominated index, prevailed over MICEX. However, as of late February, 2013, as soon as the Ruble has started to fall, the indices did overlap, and the spread between them has started to increase. Which may has been a sign of the local currency struggling for some reasons -- let's have a look at long term bonds rates ([data](http://www.cbr.ru/hd_base/Default.aspx?Prtid=gkoofz_mr) provided by the Central Bank of Russia):

And here again, we see the trajectory, which seconds market moods being not in favour of Russian economy. As of March, 2014 the bond rate hikes and the spread between RTS and MICEX increases and oth indices go down, mirroring the gloom outlook of the Russia's stock market -- something seems to be coming, and today we all know what exactly it was: the so-called [referendum of Crimea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimean_status_referendum,_2014) held at a gun-point.

Now, let's expand the timeline and examine the RTS and MICEX indices' behaviour till the current date -- let's also add their 50 days moving averages to the graph in order to spot their movement easier (note that the dotted vertical lines indicates the 17th of July, 2014, the day on which the international passenger flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur [Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 (MH17)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia_Airlines_Flight_17) was shot down):

As it may be seen, July of 2014 was exactly the turning point of the whole [Russian crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_financial_crisis_%282014%E2%80%93present%29): the spread between two indices we were looking at has gone enormous, the Ruble has fallen to record low, and there's literally no light may be seen today.

So, was this situation coming then? It may indeed be suggested that way -- yet the [declining economy](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/russia/gdp-growth) was still rather steady, and no actual indications of crisis were in sight. But as [Vyacheslav von Plehve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vyacheslav_von_Plehve) has said once in reference to the [Russo-Japanese War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Japanese_War): "What this country needs is a short, victorious war to stem the tide of revolution", and the Kremlin decided to go that way. Yet there was no real sign of any possible revolution back in 2014, and the war has developed into a humanitarian catastrophe since then.

So, was it avoidable then? Sure. But was there a will to avoid it, that's the question.
