title: On innovations

Today we are more than ever living in a world of constant innovation. But what exactly drives those innovations, how are breakthroughs achieved? Let's have a look at the ["Proven Paths to Innovation Success"](http://www.strategyand.pwc.com/media/file/Proven-Paths-to-Innovation-Success.pdf) report by [PricewaterhouseCoopers International Limited](http://pwc.com) published during the December, 2014 -- among the other information presented in the report, the authors also introduce the so called 10 most innovative companies:

> Which companies do innovation executives around the globe consider to be the very best at discovering and developing new products and services, and bringing them to market? We have posed this question in the Global Innovation 1000 survey in each of the past five years.

Now, according to the provided results, let's examine expenditures these companies outlay in the Research&Development field. To begin with, let's have a look at the absolute numbers:

As one may notice, numbers are quite different, and the spendings in question as do vary a lot (even for companies that seem to be working in similar fields -- compare Tesla and Volkswagen, Samsung and Apple), as also, on the other hand, seem relatively similar (think Google and Microsoft or Google and Amazon). But may be there's another pattern there? Let's overlay this particular graph with the revenues from sales each company achieved in 2014 (also square root transformed as the analysis wouldn't be that obvious [otherwise](http://i.imgur.com/V41IC6n.png)):

Now, even as numbers still fluctuate a lot, some patterns are starting to emerge: 
  - First, compare now Volkswagen (oh, [my innovative dear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_emissions_scandal) and Tesla: even though their amounts do differ a lot, their revenue from sales also varies in the same direction -- not exactly, of course, but surely with a positive correlation;
  - Second, Microsoft and Google, their spendings seem like be a perfect match, they do spend an almost exact share of their sales.

But which company is the modest spender at all then? Which shareholders may be at most sure of their returns on every dollar spend on research? Well, it's not a rocket science to spot an answer -- and it may be easily proven with a relative spendings graph:

Is it a real innovation, though, or just a reflection of the consumerist society we are living in? That surely can't be answered. But Neil Cybart [wrote](http://www.aboveavalon.com/notes/2015/5/3/significant-rd-increase-suggests-apple-is-working-on-something-big) some time ago, "If Apple is spending R&D, it is a good bet they have a specific goal in mind for those dollars." And *that* pattern, I bet, will keep investors happy for some time.
