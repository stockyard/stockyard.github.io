title: On HIV/AIDS rate in Estonia
---

During its long history, the humankind faced various diseases and epidemics. However, their spread and consequences not always depended strictly on the viruses itself. Having said that, let's examine the rise of HIV/AIDS by the example of the small Baltic state Estonia.

First, let's investigate estimates of the percentage of adults (aged 15-49) living with HIV/AIDS in Estonia and some neighboring states (the adult prevalence rate is calculated by dividing the estimated number of adults living with HIV/AIDS by the total adult population). According The World Factbook by the CIA, here are the actual rates as of year 2009:

Now, according to the [study](http://rahvatervis.ut.ee/bitstream/1/1582/1/L%C3%B5hmusjt2009_1.pdf), published the National Institute for Health Development of Estonia in 2009, patients, who went to see a HIV-Infectionist in three different cities, Tallinn, Kohtla-Jaerve and Narva, can be divided into three main groups according to the nationality (page 9, table 3): Russians account for 83.1%, Estonians for 11.1% and all the others for 5.8%. If for simplicity we now combine Estonians with the other nationalities, the previous graph can be transformed in the following way:

Having in mind that as of 01-01-2010, the population of Estonia [included](http://estonia.eu/about-estonia/country/population-by-nationality.html) 25.5% of Russians, we can calculate separate rates for the nationalities:

Moreover, according to the [presentation by Dr. Paul Downes](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/nordicbaltic/HealthWelfare/PaulSlides), as from 1 October 2009 to 7 June 2010, 115 new persons were registered as HIV-positive (page 25). Those can be separated according to the social-economic status, too:
  * 44% - prisoners
  * 31% - unemployed
  * 18% - working
  * 3% - students of higher education institutions 
  * 3% - disability / age pensioners
  * 2% - on maternity leave

Having said all that, we may find ourselves facing several other questions, such as the following:
  * The Russian population of Estonia may (or may not) be far worse integrated into the social-economic life of the state;
  * The spread of HIV/AIDS may (may not) be attributed to the social-economic status of patients;
  * etc.

However, to answer those questions we must also conduct an actual statistical study, which is definitely too complex and too irrelevant as of this blog: here I present only my observations, not conclusions.
