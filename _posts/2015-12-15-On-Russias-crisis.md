title: On Russia's economic crisis
---

As many out here probably know, today Russia's facing one of the harshest economic crises: its [GDP shrinks](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-08-10/russian-economy-shrinks-4-6-as-oil-slump-risks-deeper-recession), the budget deficit is inevitable for the [forth year in a row](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/russia/government-budget) (will be also on the cards for the year 2016), the dropoff in real wages is the steepest [since 1999](https://twitter.com/wbstevens/status/674193389546508288), and the annual inflation has already soared into double digits. 

However, as of the [latter](http://inflationinrussia.com/inflation_table.aspx), there seem to be some positive tendencies, too -- let's have a look at the monthly data:

One of the obvious measures to fight inflation is to limit the money supply. And of the easiest measures for banks to obtain additional money, is a [repurchase agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repurchase_agreement). Now, let's take a look how the Repo limits have changed throughout year 2015:

Or, let's combine it with the inverted monthly inflation:

Some similarities are here, right? However, limiting the money supply to the banks may also introduce not so pleasant side effects like the crisis of the banking system itself. And indeed, the number of banks that were closed in 2015 is more than hundred already (was 98 as of November):

But does it have any relation to the Repo limits?

Or, let's again invert the repo limits graph for some kind of better vizualizaion:

It's rather obvious that one cannot say there's clear and definite pattern in the graph. Nonetheless, the trend that took stage since May, 2015, may be very well worth watching, and -- having in mind that Repo limits were once again lessened in December -- it will interesting to re-review these patterns some two or three months later.
