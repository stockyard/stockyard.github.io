title: On emerging markets
---

According to JPMorgan, of 22 big emerging markets tracked, 21 have seen their 2016 economic growth forecasts downgraded in the past three months (except for the Czech Republic, which remained flat).

Aside from the fact that the emerging markets to some extent mirror the tendencies of the developed world (on a much broader scale), it's also worth to note that the continued slide in the prices of commodities, particularly energy, also has its impact on commodity exporters. On the other hand, as for commodity importers, some of them are using this as an excuse to lower fuel subsidies, for example.

Now, let's have a look at the returns produced by BRIC states for the last 6 months (data provided by [ECR Research](http://www.ecrresearch.com/)) -- both in local currencies:

â€¦and in Euros:

Indeed, we see the obvious decline over the provided period, and the only state showing positive returns in its local currency is the Russian Federation -- which is due to Rouble going cheap against Euro. To illustrate that, let's subtract Rouble returns from Euro ones and then compare that delta against the exchange rate of Rouble against Euro:

Having said all that, it's also important to note an interest rate increase from the U.S. Federal Reserve, which would also lead to -- again -- lower commodity prices and a stronger dollar, both of which will conspire to create headwinds for emerging markets in the first half of 2016.

On the other hand, as JPMorgan notes, an increase in corporate debt is a source of concern in emerging markets. Non-financial corporate debt is pegged at 76.2% of GDP in 2015, compared with 48.4%of GDP for government debt and 29.5 percent of GDP for household debt.

However, as most of the buildup in corporate debt is domestic debt in the form of private sector loans, sovereign indebtedness is estimated to grow more modestly, but market participants should pay close attention to banks of emerging markets.

Summing up, it's only logical to expect little or no additional inflows into emerging markets bond funds over 2016additional .
