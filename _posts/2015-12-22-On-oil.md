title: On oil
---

Today, as oil falls to record lows, many of us may wonder, what will happen to the price next, especially since Iran is soon to return to the market. Now, let's have a look at the oil production and consumption (data provided by the [U.S. Energy Information Administration](https://www.eia.gov/)):

Note the intersection and the switch of leads that occured back in 2014, isn't it, an oversupply, a serious factor for the current decline in prices? After all, it's the demand that dictates prices, and if demand is met with surplus, wouldn't it affect the price? For a better visualization, let's calculate and picture the delta between these two:

First, it's easy to note how huge it was in the late 2014 and during the whole 2015. And next -- that it's going to shrink down in 2016. Why so? As EIA states, that's because of the decline in the production by non-OPEC states¹:

Which exactly? Russia, on the contrary, only [increases](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-20/siberian-surprise-russian-oil-patch-just-keeps-pumping) its [production](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-20/siberian-surprise-the-numbers-behind-russia-s-oil-resilience), Brazil's Petrobras [while](http://en.mercopress.com/2015/09/17/petrobras-oil-gas-production-in-august-sets-new-records-subsalt-output-up-61-in-twelve-months) not with [particular good results](http://petroglobalnews.com/2015/12/strike-puts-small-dent-in-petrobras-november-production/) after the strike, is back in action, Norway's production is [still](http://www.hellenicshippingnews.com/start-of-oil-production-at-the-edvard-grieg-field-in-the-norwegian-north-sea/) [expanding](http://www.offshore-technology.com/news/newslundin-discovers-oil-in-rolvsnes-prospect-offshore-norway-4760583) and is higher than expected (November's numbers are 1'598'000 barrels of oil, which is about 3% above the oil production back in November, 2014), and Canada is rather [steady](http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Energy-Industry/2015/12/17/Canadian-oil-sector-resilient-sort-of/6001450350312/), too.

Apparently, it the United States itself, who are to blame:

> Non-OPEC production growth in 2015 is largely attributable to investments committed to projects before the oil price decline that began in mid-2014. The declines in 2016 are mostly because of declines in U.S. onshore and North Sea production.

Then, how will it affect the price? My guess is not much: the spread between the consumption and the production is still pretty solid, and that reality is to be here for some time. On the other hand, having in mind the lifting of the export ban and the return of the Iran, decline in some -- unprofitable -- projects will only support and bolster others, which are steadier for now.

**Updated:** OPEC [agrees](http://www.wsj.com/articles/opec-report-suggests-oil-price-rebound-supply-cut-1450864802) to a certain extent:

> The “need to develop oil production in more expensive areas will drive long-term oil prices higher,” OPEC said in its report. Much of the recent oversupply has been led by the development of costly reservoirs in the U.S. and Canada, which started to slow after oil prices more than halved in the past year.

On the other side, they also note that:

> …oil supply from the U.S. and Canada would reach 19.8 million barrels a day by 2020, an increase of 2.5 million barrels a day over 2014.Even production of U.S. light-tight oil—in which hydraulic-fracturing techniques extract crude from shale formations, at a cost often higher than $50 a barrel—is expected to rise to 5.2 million barrels a day in 2020 from 4.4 million barrels a day this year, according to the organization.

And Goldman Sachs seems to [second that](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/b72ed024-a89f-11e5-955c-1e1d6de94879.html):

> In a report Goldman said global oil production had outpaced demand by a “significant” 1.5m barrels a day in the fourth quarter, a level that could be sustained into the second half of next year because of production “surprises” and mild winter weather, which has dented demand.
> 
> “We view the oversupply as continuing well into next year before rebalancing in the fourth quarter of 2016,” said the report, which repeated the bank’s view that prices may need to fall to $20 to rebalance the market.
